Customer Churn Analysis – Summary & Insights

Overall Churn Rate:

26.54% of customers have churned, indicating over one-quarter of the customer base has left.

1. Tenure Impact

Customers with only 1–2 months of service have the highest churn rates.

Churn probability decreases significantly as tenure increases — long-term customers show high loyalty.

2. Contract Type Influence

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate, suggesting these customers are more flexible to switch providers.

One-year and two-year contracts have much lower churn, showing the value of long-term commitments.

3. Services & Features

Most customers have PhoneService and fiber optic internet.

However, a majority do not subscribe to add-on services like OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, and TechSupport.

Customers without these add-ons tend to churn more, possibly indicating a lower engagement level.

4. Streaming Services

StreamingTV and StreamingMovies subscriptions are fairly balanced between Yes/No.

These services do not strongly correlate with churn in your dataset.

5. Payment Method

Customers paying through electronic check have noticeably higher churn compared to those using credit cards, bank transfers, or mailed checks.

Key Recommendations:

Target new customers in their first 2–3 months with retention offers and engagement activities.

Promote long-term contract plans through discounts or bundled services.

Encourage adoption of value-added services like security, backup, and device protection to increase customer stickiness.

Investigate electronic check customers for potential billing experience issues or offer incentives to switch payment methods.
